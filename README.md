> The ongoing Corona pandemic has recently caused a US bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, to experience significant drops in income. In the current market environment, it is extremely difficult for the organisation to remain viable. It has therefore made the conscious decision to develop a business plan that will enable it to increase revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown ends and the economy returns to a healthy state. Therefore, we made the decision to apply our machine learning expertise to meet the needs of the aforementioned company. In this project, we employ linear regression to identify key attributes that will enable Boom Bikes to succeed commercially.
